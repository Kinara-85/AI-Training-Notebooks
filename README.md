# AI Training Tasks

This repository contains several mini coding tasks completed as part of my AI training. Each task focuses on different aspects of AI, machine learning, and data processing using Python. I used 
Google Colab for these mini projects. 

## Task 1: NLP Sentiment Analysis (Method 1)
- Created a dataset containing text and sentiment scores.
- Used `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` to convert text into numerical representation.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Built and trained a `LinearRegression` model to predict sentiment scores.
- Evaluated the model using Mean Absolute Error.

## Task 2: NLP Sentiment Analysis (Method 2 - Torch)
- Tokenized text using `nltk`.
- Used `Word2Vec` from `gensim` to generate word embeddings.
- Converted embeddings into PyTorch tensors.
- Moved tensors to GPU (if available) for computations.

## Task 3: Working with PyTorch Tensors
- Created scalars, vectors, matrices, and multi-dimensional tensors.
- Explored different tensor initializations, including random, ones, and zeros tensors.
- Checked GPU availability and performed tensor operations on GPU.
- Conducted mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and matrix multiplication.
- Manipulated tensors using reshaping, unsqueezing, squeezing, permuting, and stacking operations.

Each task focuses on fundamental AI and deep learning concepts, enhancing my understanding of NLP, machine learning, and PyTorch tensor manipulations.
